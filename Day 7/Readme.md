This day I used some help from the video of [hyper-neutrino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvA0iO_gvfM&t=1175s&ab_channel=hyper-neutrino).
Please chek out his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@hyper-neutrino), it has several answers for other days using Python and his solutions are great with his thought process being good too
